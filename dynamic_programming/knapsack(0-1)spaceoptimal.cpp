/*
Qus: * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of
 * capacity `W` to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words,
 * given two integer arrays `val[0..n-1]` and `wt[0..n-1]` which represent
 * values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an
 * integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value
 * subset of `val[]` such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than
 * or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or
 * donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property)
 *
 * ### Algorithm
 * The idea is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight
 * and value of all subsets. Consider the only subsets whose total weight is
 * smaller than `W`. From all such subsets, pick the maximum value subset.
