# C++ Algorithms

This repository contains some useful algorithms and data structures. 

### Contributions

How can you contribute? It's simple!:

* Use the directory structure of the repository.
* Please describe your pull requests. 
* Don't use **bits/stdc++.h** because this is quite Linux specific and slows down the compiler process.
* Put comments in your code.
* Avoid **struct**. Instead use the **class** keyword.
* Add some test cases in the main-function.
* Suggestions for present algorithms are welcome.
