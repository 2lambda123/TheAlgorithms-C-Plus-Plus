### Installing C++ ide in your local machine
To run C++ codes you need an ide. Now one of the common and populer ide is codeblocks.
To install C++ ide you have to download [Codelocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) and install it as a normal installation in your machine.
For linux users you can run the following command in terminal to install codeblocks directly from the server.
```console
code@linux:~$ sudo apt install codeblocks
code@linux:~$ Y
```
Codeblocks comes with complier and editor and it'll set the paths in your machine automatically so you don't need to worry about anything after installing Codeblocks.

### All algorithms implemented in C++ (for education)
The implementations are for learning purpose. They may be less efficient than the implementation in the standard library.
