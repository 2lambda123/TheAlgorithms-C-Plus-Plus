 * @brief [Program to count digits 
 * in an integer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-count-digits-integer-3-different-methods)
 * @details It is a very basic math of finding number of digits in a given
 * number i.e, we can use it by inputting values whether it can be a
 * positive/negative value, let's say: an integer. There is also a second method: 
 * by using "K = floor(log10(N) + 1)", but it's only applicable for
 * numbers (not integers).
 * For more details, refer to the [Algorithms-Explanation](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Algorithms-Explanation/blob/master/en/Basic%20Math/Finding the number of digits in a number.md) repository.
