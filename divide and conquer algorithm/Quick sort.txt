Quick sort-Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. 
           A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on
           which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.

Algorithm-
Step 1 − Make the right-most index value pivot
Step 2 − partition the array using pivot value
Step 3 − quicksort left partition recursively
Step 4 − quicksort right partition recursively


Psuedocode-
function partitionFunc(left, right, pivot)
   leftPointer = left
   rightPointer = right - 1

   while True do
      while A[++leftPointer] < pivot do
         //do-nothing            
      end while
		
      while rightPointer > 0 && A[--rightPointer] > pivot do
         //do-nothing         
      end while
		
      if leftPointer >= rightPointer
         break
      else                
         swap leftPointer,rightPointer
      end if
		
   end while 
	
   swap leftPointer,right
   return leftPointer
	
end function
