/* 
what is BubbleSort?
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements 
is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity 
are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
*/

/*  
what is linked list? 
A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of data elements dynamically.
Nodes represent those data elements, and links or pointers connect each node.
Each node consists of two fields, the information stored in a linked list and a pointer that stores the address of its next node.
The last node contains null in its second field because it will point to no node.
A linked list can grow and shrink its size, as per the requirement.
It does not waste memory space.
