* @brief Implementation of Warshall's Algorithm in C++
* [Warshall's Transitive Closure Algorithm](https://www.javatpoint.com/warshalls-algorithm)
* 
* @details
* Warshall's Algorithm is used to determine
* the transitive closure of a directed graph 
* or all paths in a directed graph by using the adjacency matrix. 
* For this, it generates a sequence of n matrices.
* Where, n is used to describe the number of vertices. 
*
* i.e.,
* R(0), ..., R(k-1), R(k), ... , R(n) 
*
* In this program, maximum value of nodes 
* that can be taken under consideration is 10
* (which is changeable)
*
* Reason: In Warshall's algo, Î˜(n^3) is the worst-case cost.
* Even Brute Force method seems a viable option when compared
* to this. Therefore static 2D array is used with fixed
* input size of 10 inputs in this program in order to demonstrate
* the implementation and maintain responsiveness. 
*
* The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3)
*
* In order to generate R(k) from R(k-1),
* the following rules will be implemented:
*
* Rule 1: In row i and column j, 
* if the element is 1 in R(k-1), 
* then in R(k), it will also remain 1.
*
* Rule 2: In row i and column j,
* if the element is 0 in R(k-1), 
* then the element in R(k) will be changed to 1 
* iff the element in its column j and row k,
* and the element in row i and column k are both 1's in R(k-1). 
*
* The resulting matrix after following the steps n times and obtaining
* n number of matrices, the nth matrix is the transitive closure for
* the given adjacency matrix.
